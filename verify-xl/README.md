# XL Algorithm Verification

## Purpose

This project aims to verify the following hypothesis:  
When **D < d**, all polynomial equations generated by the XL algorithm are linearly independent.

Here:

- `D` is the chosen maximum extension degree;
- `d` is the algebraic degree of the original system of equations.

## Description

- Implement polynomial system extension and linearization in SageMath;
- Construct polynomial systems with different parameters;
- Test whether the generated equations are linearly independent when `D < d`.

## Files

- `verify_xl.sage`: Main experiment script for equation generation and independence checking;
- `README.md`: Project description.

## Usage

Run the experiment script:

```bash
sage verify_xl.sage
```
