# Chosen-IV Algebraic Attack on Randomized Ciphers: FASTA and HERA

This repository contains the validation code for the paper **"Chosen-IV Algebraic Attack on Randomized Ciphers: FASTA and HERA"**. The code includes two key components:

1. **FASTA-attack**: A script to validate the FASTA cryptographic attack.
2. **verify\_xl**: A script to validate the XL algorithm conjecture, used to assist the HERA attack.

## Overview

"FASTA-attack is the code for verifying the FASTA algorithm attack, and verify_xl is the code for verifying the XL algorithm conjecture, which is used to assist the HERA attack."
